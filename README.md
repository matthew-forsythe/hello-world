# hello-world
Repository to explore ggithub features.

My name is Matthew Forsythe and I am a Research Scientist at the New Jersey Department of Health. 
I am exploring GitHub to better understand the underlying features of Git as those features are
utilized in the AWS CodeCommit Service, or so I believe.
